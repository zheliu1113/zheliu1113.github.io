I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), supervised by Prof. [Joanna McGrenere](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~joanna/). My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction and Human-AI Interaction. Currently, I am focusing on applying AI techniques to assist semi-structured interviews.

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from the [School of Public Health Sciences](https://uwaterloo.ca/public-health-sciences/) at [The University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I was co-supervised by Prof. [Daniel Vogel](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/dvogel) and Prof. [James Wallace](https://uwaterloo.ca/public-health-sciences/profiles/james-wallace). My work there involved exploring multi-touch interaction with large displays. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in the Department of [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/). During this time, I had the privilege of working with Prof. Pulsing Choe and Prof. Patrick Rau, contributing to interaction design for older adults and hand rehabilitation.
